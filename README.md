# Tanzania Well Functionality: A Management Perspective
  By: Samira Chatrathi and Brian Reynolds

# Overview
  In this project we take Tanzanian Well Data from the DrivenData competition to build a classification model to predict which wells are functional, non functional, and functional and need repair. 


# Business Understanding/Stakeholder
Tanzania has struggled with finding a solution to their water crisis for years. Not only is the affordability of clean water an issue, but the infrastructre and maintenance for water has also proven to be a consistent problem for Tanzania. 









Our stakeholder is . Water is a non-government organization that is looking to implement the effectiveness of their water pumps. They want to see how to optimize their time and resources to effectively predict whether a water pump is functional, non existent, or just broken and needs repair. By understanding this distinction, our stakeholder will be able to deploy their resources effectively and efficiently.
# Data
