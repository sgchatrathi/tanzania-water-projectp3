# Overview
  In this project we take Tanzanian Well Data from the DrivenData competition to build a classification model to predict which wells are functional, non functional, and functional and need repair. 

# Business Understanding/Stakeholder
Tanzania has struggled with finding a solution to their water crisis for years. Not only is the affordability of clean water an issue, but the infrastructure and maintenance for water has also proven to be a consistent problem for Tanzania. As a means of supporting Tanzania's sustainable development, this ongoing issue needs to be fundamentally reevaluated. Our stakeholder is Water.org, a non-government organization that is looking to implement a vast manageable amount of water pumps within the country. Before deploying teams into Tanzania blindly, they want to see how they can optimize their time and resources to effectively predict whether a water pump is functional, non existent, or just broken and needs repair. Not only is Water.org focusing on fixing non functional wells themselves, but they are also focusing on prioritizing efficiency and optimizing long term scalability.

# Data
 The dataset includes information on 59,400 wells, each of which has 41 different features.

# Evaluation
Feature selection of our models:

From our decision tree of political characteristics, payment, permit, region and source had the highest feature importance in our model.
